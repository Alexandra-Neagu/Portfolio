# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*


# Questions for the TA
 - What is the deadline for the Responsible Computer Science Assignment? Should we have the document ready before the Design Document Draft deadline?
 - Should we create a new branch (e.g. agendas) to push the weekly agendas to the repository?
 - Are we allowed to use additional APIs, such as the Google Calender API for scheduling a meeting?
 - When do you expect us to carry out the Heuristic Evaluation?
 - Which sources can we use for icons and images in our application?
 - How should lecturers join their own lectures?
 - Should we have a date picker or something like that?
 - What is BuddyCheck, how does it work and when's the deadline?
