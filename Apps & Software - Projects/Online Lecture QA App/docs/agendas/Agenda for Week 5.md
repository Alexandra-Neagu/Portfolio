# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
 - Testing
 - More features
 - Organize the gitlab issues? (Add more detailed descriptions, time estimates)

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*


# Questions for the TA
 - Does it matter if in some commits the pipeline fails/failed (before we figured out the CheckStyle, when we were figuring out how to setup the DB)?
 - What layers/classes of the software do we need to test? And how do we do it?
 - Is it reasonable and efficient to have separate issues for backend and frontent development even though they are a part of the same functionality?
 - For joining the users to lectures, is it enough to have one field in each entity, or should we have a table connecting a user to a room?

# Question round


# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
