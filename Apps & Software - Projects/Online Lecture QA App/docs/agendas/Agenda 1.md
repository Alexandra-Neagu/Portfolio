# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*


# Questions for the TA
 - Where are we going to upload the Code of Conduct and the Backlog Draft?
 - Should only one person upload the Code of Conduct?
 - What should the Backlog contain?
 - When will we start coding?
 - Is there going to be a lecture that's gonna help us use Spring?
 - Does the looks of the project matter?
 - Does the app need to have a logo or app icon?
 - What is the difference between the agenda and the notes?

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
- Why are there two sections for the questions in the agenda?
- How important is the GUI of the app compared to the backend?

# Closing
