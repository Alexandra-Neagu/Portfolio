- What exactly defines a 'task round'? Is it a single phase the robot is in, or the completion of a task, like searching a room/dropping a victim? Or is it the completion of the whole game?
- How are we supposed to keep track of confidence? If we don't maintain it between different iterations of the game, how will trust values converge? At the start of each game, say confidence is reset to 0%, it will result in some trust disparities?
- What factors into competence? There is strength of the human, but what about speed?
